🛠 Mini Project: Heartbeat Sensor

I'm thrilled to share that I’ve successfully completed a Heartbeat Sensor mini project as part of my semester project for Linear Integrated Circuits and Applications (LICA)!

Working of the Circuit:

➔ This project involves using an IR transmitter and receiver to detect the variation in blood flow through the finger.
➔ The reflected IR signal is processed using an LM358N operational amplifier to amplify the weak signal.
➔ A capacitor-resistor network helps filter out noise and stabilize the output.
➔ The processed signal is then fed to an Arduino, which calculates the heartbeat rate in BPM (Beats Per Minute) and displays it on an LCD screen.
➔ An LED blinks in sync with each detected pulse, providing real-time visual feedback.

This project gave me valuable insights into analog signal processing, sensor interfacing, and microcontroller programming. It also marked my first experience of soldering on a zero PCB - a crucial step in developing practical circuit-building skills!
